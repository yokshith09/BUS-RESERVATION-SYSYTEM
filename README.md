# BUS-RESERVATION-SYSYTEM
🚌 Bus Reservation System – Python + DSA Project
This project is a console-based Bus Reservation System developed using Python and core Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). It simulates a basic reservation interface where users can search for buses, check availability, and book seats based on their travel details.

🔧 Features
🔎 Search Buses: Find available buses based on boarding point, destination, date, and time

📅 View Schedule: Displays predefined bus routes and timings

🎫 Seat Booking: Allows booking of available seats with real-time updates

🧾 Passenger Details: Records and manages basic passenger information during booking

❌ Cancel Reservation: Option to cancel booked seats

🧠 Uses DSA Concepts: Arrays, linked lists, queues, and sorting/search algorithms implemented for better logic handling

📂 Modules Used
Bus: Class with attributes like bus number, route, available seats

ReservationSystem: Class to handle search, booking, and cancellation

Main.py: Entry point to interact with the system via CLI

🧠 DSA Concepts Implemented
✅ Arrays – for seat allocation and schedule handling

✅ Linear Search / Binary Search – for finding buses/routes

✅ Linked Lists / Queues (if implemented) – for managing booking queues

✅ Sorting (optional) – to display buses in order of time or route

👨‍💻 Use Case
Ideal for learning:

Object-Oriented Programming in Python

Practical application of DSA

Basic system simulation and user interaction logic
